## Pull request checklist

To reviewers: most items from the following list should be checked off. If some items are not checked off, look for an explanation below the checklist. If there isn't an explanation (and the reason is not self-evident) or the explanation is insufficient, you should feel free to reject the PR.

<!--
To the author:

Leave the checklist unmodified. After the PR is created, see if you can check
off all of the items here.

You are discouraged from ignoring these requirements. But if you find yourself
doing so, consider explaining your reasons below the checklist.
